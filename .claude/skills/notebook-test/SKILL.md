# notebook-test

**Description:** Test an existing Jupyter notebook by executing it in an isolated environment and reporting results. Read-only -- does not modify the notebook.

---

## Shared Workflow

**Read [../notebook-create/NOTEBOOK_WORKFLOW.md](../notebook-create/NOTEBOOK_WORKFLOW.md) first.** It covers the two-environment architecture, jupytext setup, dependency validation, API key management, LLM defaults, error handling, and cleanup.

---

## Key Principle

**This skill is STRICTLY READ-ONLY.** It tests whether a notebook executes without errors, but does not modify the original `.ipynb` file. There is no conversion back to `.ipynb`.

> **DO NOT modify the `.py` script** generated by jupytext, with one exception.
>
> - **Never** use the Edit or Write tools on the converted `.py` script to fix errors, refactor code, or change logic.
> - The **only** allowed modifications are: (a) loading `.env` variables before execution, (b) installing the dependencies extracted from `!pip install` lines, and **(c) removing Colab-specific code that cannot run locally** (see shared workflow for the list of patterns).
> - If the script fails for any other reason, **report the error** — do not fix it. Diagnosing and reporting is the purpose of this skill. Use `notebook-edit` for fixes.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Setup

```bash
PROJECT_DIR="$(pwd)"
TEMP_DIR="/tmp/notebook_test_$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p "$TEMP_DIR"
cd "$TEMP_DIR"
```

Ensure `.venv_tools` exists (see shared workflow for jupytext setup).

### 2. Convert Notebook to Python

```bash
$PROJECT_DIR/.venv_tools/bin/jupytext --to py $PROJECT_DIR/notebooks/<notebook_name>.ipynb --output <notebook_name>.py
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Extract and install the dependencies from the notebook:

```bash
grep -E "^# !pip install" <notebook_name>.py | sed 's/^# !pip install //' > requirements.txt
uv venv venv_notebook
uv pip install --python venv_notebook $(cat requirements.txt) 2>&1 | tee install_log.txt
```

If installation fails, note the dependency conflicts for the error report.

### 3.5. Remove Colab-Specific Code

Before executing, read the `.py` file and use the Edit tool to remove any Colab-specific lines (see the shared workflow's "Colab-Specific Code" section for the full list of patterns). Keep track of what you removed so you can mention it in the final report.

If no Colab-specific code is found, skip this step.

### 4. Execute the Script

**Run the script as-is. Do NOT edit the `.py` file to fix errors.**

```bash
# Load .env if it exists
if [ -f "$PROJECT_DIR/.env" ]; then
  export $(grep -v '^#' "$PROJECT_DIR/.env" | xargs)
fi
uv run --python venv_notebook/bin/python <notebook_name>.py 2>&1 | tee execution_log.txt
```

### 5. Report Results

**If execution fails, your job is to diagnose and report, NOT to fix. The `notebook-edit` skill should be used for fixes.**

#### If execution succeeds:

Report that the notebook executed successfully. Include any relevant output summaries.

#### If execution fails:

Provide a structured error report with:

1. **Error message**: The exact error and traceback from the execution log
2. **Location**: Which cell/section of the notebook failed (identify the relevant code)
3. **Possible causes**: Explain what likely went wrong, e.g.:
   - Missing or incompatible dependency versions
   - API key not set or expired
   - Network-dependent code failing offline
   - Hardcoded paths or environment-specific assumptions
   - Breaking changes in upstream libraries
   - Data files or resources not available
4. **Suggested fixes**: Concrete steps to resolve each possible cause, e.g.:
   - "Add `package==X.Y.Z` to the `!pip install` cell"
   - "Set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable before running"
   - "Update the import from `old_module` to `new_module` (changed in v2.0)"
   - "Replace the hardcoded path with a relative path or URL"

### 6. Cleanup

```bash
cd "$PROJECT_DIR"
rm -rf "$TEMP_DIR"
```

## Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. Setup
PROJECT_DIR="$(pwd)"
TEMP_DIR="/tmp/notebook_test_$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p "$TEMP_DIR" && cd "$TEMP_DIR"

# 2. Convert to Python (DO NOT modify the output)
$PROJECT_DIR/.venv_tools/bin/jupytext --to py $PROJECT_DIR/notebooks/<notebook_name>.ipynb --output <notebook_name>.py

# 3. Install dependencies
grep -E "^# !pip install" <notebook_name>.py | sed 's/^# !pip install //' > requirements.txt
uv venv venv_notebook
uv pip install --python venv_notebook $(cat requirements.txt) 2>&1 | tee install_log.txt

# 3.5. Remove Colab-specific lines from <notebook_name>.py using the Edit tool
#      (IPython kernel shutdown, drive.mount, files.upload, etc. — see shared workflow)
#      Note removed lines for inclusion in the final report.

# 4. Execute (DO NOT edit the .py file except to remove Colab-specific code)
if [ -f "$PROJECT_DIR/.env" ]; then export $(grep -v '^#' "$PROJECT_DIR/.env" | xargs); fi
uv run --python venv_notebook/bin/python <notebook_name>.py 2>&1 | tee execution_log.txt

# 5. Report results (success or structured error report — do NOT fix errors)
#    If Colab-specific lines were removed, mention them in the report.

# 6. Cleanup
cd "$PROJECT_DIR" && rm -rf "$TEMP_DIR"
```
